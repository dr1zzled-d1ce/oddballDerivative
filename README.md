# oddballDerivative: work in progress

This is my version of the Oddball. Atulloh was kind enough to send their personal kicad files to me.

I have no experience in KiCad or electronics whatsoever, so most of this was made possible due to a lot of generous people in the ergo community.

The major difference is that the thumb pcb has 3 keys instead of 2. The main pcb is pretty much untouched from the original.

Thanks to:
* atulloh/tullonator, for making the original Oddball
* u/Tweetydabirdie
* the Absolem Club
* the QMK discord
* the 40% Keyboards discord
